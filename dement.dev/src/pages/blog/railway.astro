            A look at Railway functions - the most convenient way I've seen to deploy serverless functions & how I implemented a blog post view counter using them.

            I've been using <a class="text-amber-300" href="https://railway.com">Railway</a> for a while now for pretty much everything I build. Usually a Postgres DB + a docker containerized server. This has worked out great for me,
            and I love the convenience, and ecosystem that Railway provides. In this blog post I want
            to cover what Railway functions are, how you can get started with them, and a quick walk through of how I implemented a blog post view counter using them.
